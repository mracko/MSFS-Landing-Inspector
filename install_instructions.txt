MSFS LANDING INSPECTOR

1. ABOUT

MSFS Landing Inspector is a tool for analyzing landings in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. It reads the airplane’s telemetry data via SimConnect and displays relevant information about your landing in a web browser. The MSFS Landing Inspector is free to use.

MSFS Landing Inspector displays the following data:

- Current vertical G force
- Current vertical speed
- Touchdown G force
- Touchdown vertical speed
- Touchdown airspeed
- Touchdown pitch, bank and heading
- Touchdown wind speed and direction
- Graph showing G forces during landing
- Graph showing vertical speed during landing
- Graph showing altitude above ground during landing
- Graph showing airspeed during landing
- Graph showing pitch, bank and heading during landing
- Graph showing wind speed and direction during landing

Update Version 1.2 (October 7, 2020):

- Improved G force values at touchdown.
- Added new data readings (airspeed, pitch, bank, heading, wind speed/direction).
- Added custom icons for HTML site.

Update Version 1.1 (October 1, 2020):

- Fixed -999999 values caused by low frame rates.
- Fixed vertical speed to represent true values instead of indicated.
- Landing rating is now based on the vertical speed at touchdown.
- Improved visualization of charts. Different colors are now shown for data when airborne and when on the ground.

2. REQUIREMENTS

- Python 3.7 64-bit or later
- Flask library

3. INSTALLATION

- Install the latest Python 3 64-bit Release for Windows. Download the installer from the official Python website. Here is a direct link to the Python 3.8.6 64-bit installer (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.6/python-3.8.6-amd64.exe). Tick the Add Python 3.8 to PATH checkbox when installing Python.
- Run Command Prompt. Do this by pressing Win + R. Type cmd.exe and click OK.
- In the Command Prompt window type pip install flask and press Enter. When asked to download any other Python dependencies, type y and press Enter. This will install the Flask Python library.

4. RUNNING MSFS LANDING INSPECTOR

- Start a flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator
- Download and unzip the MSFS Landing Inspector repository and run msfs_landing_inspector.py by double-clicking on it. This should launch a Command Prompt window. Don't close this window.
- Open your browser and load the site localhost:5000. This should load up the MSFS Landing Inspector in your browser.

5. RUNNING MSFS LANDING INSPECTOR OB YOUR MOBILE DEVICE

- Make sure your PC and your mobile device are connected to the same local network and that your home network is set to Private in your Network Profile settings.
- Run Command Prompt. Do this by pressing Win + R.
- In the Command Prompt window type ipconfig and press Enter. Look for the line IPv4 Address and write down the IP address. In my case, it's 192.168.0.120. You will most likely have a different IP address. Close the Command Prompt window.
- Start a flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator
- Download and unzip the MSFS Landing Inspector repository and run msfs_landing_inspector.py by double-clicking on it. This should launch a Command Prompt window. Don't close this window.
- On your mobile device, load the following site in the browser: <IP address you've written down>:5000. In my case, this would be 192.168.0.120:5000. MSFS Landing Inspector should now load on your mobile device.
